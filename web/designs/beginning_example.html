                    Coagulation (water treatment) In water treatment,
                    coagulation and flocculation involve the addition of
                    compounds that promote the clumping of fine floc into larger
                    floc so that they can be more easily separated from the
                    water. Coagulation is a chemical process that involves
                    neutralization of charge whereas flocculation is a physical
                    process and does not involve neutralization of charge. The
                    coagulation-flocculation process can be used as a
                    preliminary or intermediary step between other water or
                    wastewater treatment processes like filtration and
                    sedimentation. Iron and aluminium salts are the most widely
                    used coagulants but salts of other metals such as titanium
                    and zirconium have been found to be highly effective as
                    well.
